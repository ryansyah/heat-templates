Heat Templates
==============

Heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using
templates

This repository provides:

* Example templates which demonstrate Heat functionality
* Templates for my own personal use

These heat templates are tested to work with the [Rackspace Public Cloud](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public).
